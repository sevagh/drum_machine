Pipe [harmonixset](https://github.com/urinieto/harmonixset) beat txt files through `harmonixc` to listen to a clicktrack.

The clicktrack is generated from [libmetro](https://github.com/sevagh/libmetro) and the [stk](https://github.com/thestk/stk).

The beat txt files are parsed using a handwritten tokenizer/lexer and parser, based on [this tutorial](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2014/parsers-lexers/).
